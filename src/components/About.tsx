      <h2>Hype Markets üî•</h2>
      <p>
        Hype Markets reward voters on predicting outcomes early. Two factors
        play into this: popularity and timeliness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Popularity means a voter was correct in predicting which symbol would be
        the most voted for. The more votes a symbol has at the end of the cycle,
        the more the voter is rewarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Timeliness is a result of how early the vote was placed in relation to
        other votes for the same symbol.
      </p>

      <h2>Rewards ü§ë</h2>
      <p>
        Once a voting cycle has ended, the player who voted for the most popular
        symbol <em>first</em> will be rewarded most. The player who voted for
        the least popular symbol <em>last</em> will gain minimal rewards.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hype market is completely independent and self-funding, so any money
        lost as a result of a bad bet will be rewarded to voters with good bets.
      </p>

      <h2>Example Race üèéÔ∏è</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine the following race takes place in chronological order. Votes
        cost 0.01 ETH each and the reward multiplier is 10x.
